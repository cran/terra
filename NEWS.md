
# version 1.2-5

## new

- `trim` has a new argument `value` that allows trimming rows and columns with other values than the default `NA`.
- `rapp` has a new argument `clamp` that allows clamping start and end values to `1:nlyr(x)`, avoiding that all values are considered `NA`.
- `spatSample,SpatRaster-method` has new arguments `as.points` and `values`. Getting values, cells and coordinates is no longer mutually exclusive. In response to [#191](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/191). Requested by Agustin Lobo
- `area,SpatRaster-method` has a new argument `mask=FALSE`.
- `classify` can now take a single number to request that many cuts.
- `mosaic` and `merge` now warn and resample if rasters are not aligned.


## bug fixes

- `flip(x, direction="vertical")` no longer reverses the order of the layers. 
- `extract` did not work for horizontal or vertical lines as their extent was considered invalid. Reported by Monika Tomaszewska.
- `autocor` did not handle NA values [#192](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/192). Reported by Laurence Hawker.
- `nearest` now works for angular coordinates
- The unit of `slope` in `terrain` was not correct (the tangent was returned instead of the slope) [#196](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/196). Reported by Sven Alder.
`quantile` now works for rasters that have cells that are all `NA`. Reported by Jerry Nelson.
